# Minimal `flask` + `docker-compose` + `redis` + external `css`
This application is designed to be as small and clean as possible while displaying as many as possible features. It is intended to be forked for developing similar examples with small variations e.g. other database servers than redis, or including javascript frameworks.

remember to use `ctrl+shift+R` to hard refresh, otherwise cached static files will be used instead of updated ones
